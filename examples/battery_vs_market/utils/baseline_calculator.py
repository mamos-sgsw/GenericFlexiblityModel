    Calculate pure market settlement baseline cost without FlexAssets.

    This represents the "do nothing" scenario where all imbalances are settled
    directly through the market without any optimization or battery usage.

    Args:
        imbalance:
            Dict mapping timestep -> imbalance power [kW].
            Positive = deficit (need to import from market).
            Negative = surplus (can export to market).

        p_buy:
            Dict mapping timestep -> buy price [CHF/kWh].
            Price for importing energy from the market.

        p_sell:
            Dict mapping timestep -> sell price [CHF/kWh].
            Price for exporting energy to the market.

        dt_hours:
            Timestep duration [hours]. Default: 0.25 (15 minutes).

    Returns:
        Tuple of (baseline_cost, baseline_cost_annual):
            - baseline_cost: Total cost for the simulation period [CHF]
            - baseline_cost_annual: Annualized cost assuming 365 days/year [CHF/year]

    Example:
        >>> p_buy = {0: 0.10, 1: 0.12, 2: 0.11}
        >>> p_sell = {0: 0.08, 1: 0.09, 2: 0.07}
        >>> imbalance = {0: 100.0, 1: -50.0, 2: 75.0}  # kW
        >>> baseline, annual = calculate_baseline_cost(imbalance, p_buy, p_sell)
        >>> print(f"Baseline: {baseline:.2f} CHF")
        >>> print(f"Annual: {annual:.2f} CHF/year")
