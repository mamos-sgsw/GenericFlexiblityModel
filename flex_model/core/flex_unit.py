FlexUnit: Physical modeling of flexibility-providing units.

This module provides the base class for modeling the techno-physical behavior of
flexibility assets in energy systems. FlexUnit is designed to capture ONLY the
physical and technical constraints, independent of any economic or market considerations.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
-----------------
Separation of concerns:
    - FlexUnit handles PHYSICS: power limits, energy capacity, ramp rates, efficiency
    - CostModel handles ECONOMICS: prices, degradation costs, revenues
    - FlexAsset handles OPERATIONS: combines physics + economics for decision-making

Time-dependent interface:
    - All physical properties are functions of time index t (integer)
    - Methods like availability(t), power_limits(t), capacity(t) allow time-varying behavior
    - Time resolution (dt) is not fixed; the model is horizon-agnostic

Energy headroom concept:
    - E_plus(t): energy that can still be DRAWN (upward flexibility)
    - E_minus(t): energy that can still be INJECTED (downward flexibility)
    - These evolve over time based on operational commands via update_state()

KEY PHYSICAL QUESTIONS ANSWERED BY FLEXUNIT
--------------------------------------------
1. How much extra energy can I draw or inject at time t?
2. What are the instantaneous power limits?
3. How fast can I change power (ramp limits)?
4. For how long can I sustain a given activation (duration constraints)?
5. Which discrete operating states are actually available?

CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF FLEXUNIT SUBCLASSES
-----------------------------------------
- BatteryUnit: Electrical storage with SOC, C-rate limits, efficiency losses
- ThermalStorageUnit: Hot water tank with temperature stratification, thermal losses
- HeatPumpUnit: COP-dependent operation, temperature constraints
- EVChargingUnit: Time-dependent availability (plugged in/out), SOC constraints
- PVCurtailmentUnit: Discrete curtailment states, irradiance-dependent availability
- IndustrialDRUnit: Load shedding with minimum rest periods, event costs

TYPICAL WORKFLOW
----------------
1. Create a FlexUnit subclass instance:
    battery = BatteryUnit(name="BESS_1", capacity_kwh=100, power_kw=50, efficiency=0.95)

2. Initialize state:
    battery.reset_state(E_plus_init=50.0, E_minus_init=50.0)  # 50% SOC

3. Query physical limits:
    P_import_max, P_export_max = battery.power_limits(t=10)

4. Execute operation:
    battery.update_state(t=10, P_grid_import_cmd=20.0, P_grid_export_cmd=0.0)

5. Check new state:
    soc = battery.E_plus / battery.C_spec

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBCLASSES
-------------------------------------------
Abstract methods that MUST be implemented:
    - power_limits(t): Return (P_import_max, P_export_max) based on current state

Optional methods to override:
    - ramp_limits(t): Return (dP_import_max, dP_export_max) if ramp constraints exist
    - duration_limits(): Return (t_max_active, t_min_rest) for min up/down times
    - capacity(t): Override if capacity is time-dependent (e.g., temperature effects)
    - feasible_access_states(t): Override to filter discrete states dynamically

State management:
    - Call update_state() from subclass after computing losses/gains
    - Use reset_state() to initialize or restart simulation
