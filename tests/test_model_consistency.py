Model consistency tests for FlexAsset representations.

These tests verify that different representations of the same FlexAsset
(operational interface vs. linear model vs. future GA/DP representations)
produce equivalent results for the same operation sequences.

This does NOT test optimizer performance or solution quality.
It IS instead testing that model representations are internally consistent.
